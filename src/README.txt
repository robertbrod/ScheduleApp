Directions: When running application you will immediately be met with a login window. After successfully logging in you
can view, modify, and delete customers, or switch to the appointments window to be able to complete the same functions.
From the appointments window, you can navigate to and from the reports window. All login attempts are logged.
Additional Report: Along with the two other required appointment totals I have included a total appointment count for
each contact in the system as this is an important data point for assessing productivity.
